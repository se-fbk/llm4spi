    The general API for evaluating an LLM/AI in its ability to construct pre- and post-conditions
    from their informal descriptions. The AI is generically represented by an PromptResponder-object,
    which has a method takes a prompt-string as input, and returns a new string as the answer 
    to the prompt.
    
    This API takes a dataset as its input, which is a file containing a JSON-list.
    Each item in the list is called a Problem. It represents a program (for now, a Python-function) whose 
    pre- and post-conditions are to be constructed. The program-code and its doc are provided, but the 
    dataset is assumed to already contain separate text-doc for the pre- and post-conditions of the program. 

    If the parameter specificProblem is specified (it is not None), then only the problem with the
    specified id will be evaluated. So, the dataset then is just a singleton-set containing that
    single problem. 
    
    For each Problem in the dataset, the LLM task is to generate a python code that is an executable version 
    of the corresponding pre-/post-condition.
    The dataset is also assumed to contain a reference solution (ground truth) for each pre-/post-condition, 
    along with tests for assessing how good the answer from the AI. 

    For each pre- or post-condition R produced by the AI, the following evaluation result is produced:
       * (1) failed: if R crashes, or if it does not even return a boolean value, or if R
                     returns None on all test-cases.
       * (2) accepted: for every test-input x (provided in the dataset), R(x) = R0(x), where R0 is the provided
                 reference solution. 
                 NOTE: Depending on the configuration in myconfig.py, test inputs for which R(x) gives None 
                 can be interpreted as 'i don't know' and are ignored from the consideration.
                 This also applies for judgement (3) and (4) below.
       * (3) too strong: if R is not accepted, and for every test input x, we have R(x) implies R0(x).
       * (4) too weak:   if R is not accepted, and for every test input x, we have R0(x) implies R(x).
       * (5) rejected: none of the above judgement is the case.

    An evaluation report, along with the produced solutions from the AI are saved in files in /results.
